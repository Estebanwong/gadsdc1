#23andMe by Jessica Garson

##What is 23andMe?
23andMe is a home genetic testing service. Called the invention of the year of 2008 by Time Magazine. Once you take the test, you receive a customized report that gives the scoop on your genetic makeup and what diseases you may be at risk for. In addition to genetic reports, there is also a social network called "relative finder" and the company owns a patent for couples to see the genetic make up of their potential baby.

##Whats up with the FDA?
On Nov. 22, 2013, the FDA sent a letter to 23andme ordering the company to stop marketing the testing kits due to the risk of false positives and negatives. 

While you can still purchase the test to find long lost relatives and to contribute the greater research community, they no longer will give you personalized reports. The company had been out of contact with the FDA since May of 2013, and had not filed the required information to allay the bureauâ€™s concerns. At SXSW this year, the head of the company said that resloving issues with the FDA is a piority.
