"Is America the “Land of Opportunity”? In two recent studies, we find that: (1) Upward income mobility varies substantially within the U.S. [summary][paper] Areas with greater mobility tend to have five characteristics: less segregation, less income inequality, better schools, greater social capital, and more stable families. (2) Contrary to popular perception, economic mobility has not changed significantly over time; however, it is consistently lower in the U.S. than in most developed countries. [summary][paper] "

Recently, there has been a lot of discussion within the US political and media landscapes regarding growing income inequality, with a commonly held belief that climbing the ladder out of poverty has become increasingly rare.  Critics from the left side of the political spectrum point to a lack of social programs to effectively enable the poor to escape the "cycle of poverty".  Critics on the right believe that many of the social programs already in place act as a "hammock", creating a sense of disempowerment and locking impoverished Americans into dependency.

But is this really a national issue?  According to a recent study from Harvard's Equality of Opportunity Project, there is a wide variation in intergenerational income mobility within the various regions of the United States.  Their study shows a strong correlation with various factors such as segregation, average commute times (a measure of urban sprawl), etc.
