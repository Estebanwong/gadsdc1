#Final project (elevator pitch edition)#

##Introducing the CFPBâ€™s consumer complaint database##

The [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](http://www.consumerfinance.gov) operates a database of consumer complaints about a variety of different financial products and services (most commonly: mortgage, debt collection and credit reporting). Consumers can submit their complaints online, over the phone or by snail-mail -- and so far close to 300,000 individual complaints have been registered!

What makes the complaint system unique is that the CFPB then requires a company to respond to the consumer in a specific timeframe (usually 15-45 days), and then buckets the response into several categories (i.e. complaint resolved in favor of consumer with monetary relief, complaint resolved without monetary relief, complaint closed, etc.). Most of this data, in turn, is put online in a de-identified, publicly accessible database ([check it out!](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaintdatabase/)). 

##That's cool, but why should we care?##

For my final project, I'd like to dig in to this data to better understand the dynamics of consumer complaints. One particular question that I know the CFPB has wrestled with for a long time revolves around auditing and investigation -- though the CFPB complaint system is principally a mechanism for connecting consumers and their financial service provider, the CFPB will also assign its own investigators to follow certain complaints and ensure a consumer is actually being treated fairly. But which complaints should it choose? How can frivolous complaints be separated from real ones? 

Data can help answer this question! By making use of the public consumer complaint database (as well as internal/proprietary data related to the actual text a consumer submits in connection with their complaint), I would like to study how the CFPB might better identify and prioritize those complaints. This will make use of the rich dataset created during the complaint intake process, as well as the complaint status outcomes that are recorded once the complaint it resolved or closed. Extensions of this research could involve creating a scoring system to predict the future outcomes of complaints based on the free-form text field submitted by a consumer.

This is my preliminary thinking, but it is poised to change. Your feedback is much appreciated!
