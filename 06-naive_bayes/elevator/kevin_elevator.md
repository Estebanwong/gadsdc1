###Project: Allstate Kaggle Competition###

For my project, I'm entering the [Allstate Purchase Prediction Challenge](http://www.kaggle.com/c/allstate-purchase-prediction-challenge) on Kaggle. The goal is to predict the exact car insurance options purchased by individual customers. The data available for training the model is the history of car insurance quotes that they reviewed, as well as data about the customer and their car. For a prediction to be counted as correct, you must successfully predict the value for all seven options, and each option has 2 to 4 possible values, thus you could view this as a classificiation problem with over 2,000 possible classes. One additional challenge is that the car insurance options are not identified in any meaningful way, preventing you from making educated guesses about what customer data might influence each option. Overall, this project will likely require a lot of effort in terms of data exploration, feature engineering, and model building.
