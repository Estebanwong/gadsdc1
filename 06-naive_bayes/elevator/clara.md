# Something something family and changing gender roles

There is a cool program (the International Social Survey Programme--[ISSP](http://www.issp.org/page.php?pageId=4)) in which member nations collect data from the same questionnaire on a rotating set of social topics. These topics include things like Role of Government, Social Inequality, Health, etc.

The first release of data from the 2012 survey--Family and Changing Gender Roles--was just released at the end of March, and I'd like to do something with it. Perhaps something like figuring out which features are most important for predicting people's overall happiness / workplace happiness / home life happiness.

It might also be interesting to look for changes over time, as similar questionnaires with many of the same questions were done in 2002, 1994, and 1988, and see if the predictions can be improved.

Unfortunately, the data from the United States was not included in the initial release of the 2012 data. If it turns out that country of origin is an important consideration, then I may wish to narrow my scope, and the US would have been my choice for what to focus on. I'll figure that out when I get there I suppose.
