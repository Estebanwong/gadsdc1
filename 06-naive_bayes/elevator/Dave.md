##imgur as the place for pictures and gifs##

With social media growing faster and bigger each year imgur is one of those places where things pop up *before* they go viral. Originally started as a site to provide gifs pictures and gifs to [reddit](www.reddit.com), it has quickly overtaken reddit in terms of web traffic. The trends in social media has been to simplify, and nothing is simpler than pictures and gifs. 

##Aren't there already a ton of websites for pictures? Why imgur?##

imgur is kind of strange because not only is there the imgur community you reach after you submit an image, but usually within a day or two it usually gets noticed in reddit (if it's popular). Then it's usually a few days after that when the mainstream media starts to pick it up. Due to the commenting and voting systems it is far more interactive and a smaller niche than a website like instagram where it is limited to each user's social networks. 

Therefore, I would like to use the imgur API to gather some more information on who is using the website, how they are using it, and how often it is being used both by members and as a feeder into other media. This would potentially give us analysis on how pictures are shared and could determine what makes an image/gif popular over time on the site. A website shows a recent snapshot of the [demographics](https://www.quantcast.com/imgur.com/demographics) with an overwhelming majority of the users both male and located in the US. 

1. But does this translate to the highest upvotes?  
2. Which users are the most popular and why? 
3. Do most users post and comment or do they simply vote? 
4. As a leading indicator when it comes to social media what are some of the upcoming trends for 2014? 
5. Exactly what percentage of imgur is "cat-related?"
