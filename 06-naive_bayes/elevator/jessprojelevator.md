##Project Elevator Pitch -- Jessica Garson

Lately I've been thinking about the gender disparity in the tech sector and for my project I wanted to create a tool that can be helpful in removing biases in the hiring process. 

For my project I will be predicting the sucuess of different resumes using keyword detection, similar to what we did with ham or spam in the last class. I've also considered using adding in a prediction that will generate a salery prediction as well.
