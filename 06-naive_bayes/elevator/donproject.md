Project Elevator: Don Vetal
========================================================

My project will analyze congressional testimony and floor records to first predict whether a given individual has a particular party affiliation.  

My hypothesis is that congressmen and women that come from districts where the registered voter population is heavily weighted to one party over another and the congressman/woman has stronger party oriented words in their discussions, the more likely the congressman will be re-elected. In other words, there is a correlation between rhetoric strength and the inbalance in registered party voters.


The End Product: You give me congressional testimony and the geographic location (district) and I'll produce a likelihood that person will be re-elected
