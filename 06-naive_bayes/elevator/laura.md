Price Prediction and Fraud Detection
===

My project will be to predict prices for various CPG grocery products and detect fradulent crowdsourced prices for CPG grocery products using multiple linear(?) regression and setting a threshold on residuals for fradulent price dropping.

Details on the proposal and some analysis details are available [on RPubs]](http://rpubs.com/lauralorenz/15070).
