# Dataset Research (The Chatterjeeâ€“Price Attitude Data)

## What are the structure and contents of the dataset?

This dataset contains the aggregated results from a survey of the clerical employees of a large financial organization.
The numbers give the percent proportion of favourable responses to seven questions in each department.

## What is the history of the dataset? Have others written about it?

The dataset comes from the textbook below and is used to explain the basic concepts of multiple linear regression models. Though the authors claim it is derived from an actual survey, I'm inclined to think the data is probably manufactured for notional purposes.
