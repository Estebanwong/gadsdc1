# Abalone dataset
These data are used for predicting the age of abalone from various physical measurements. Age in abalone can be measured accurately by cutting the shell, staining it, and counting rings.

## Structure and contents
The abalone dataset contains 4176 records of 9 variables (8 attributes, and the value to be predicted).

| Variable name | Data type  | Meas. unit | Description |
| ------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| Sex           | nominal    | n/a        | M, F, I (infant) |
| Length        | continuous | mm         | Longest shell measurement |
| Diameter      | continuous | mm         | perpendicular to length |
| Height        | continuous | mm         | with meat in shell |
| Whole weight  | continuous | grams      | whole abalone |
| Shucked weight | continuous | grams     | weight of meat |
| Viscera weight | continuous | grams     | gut weight (after bleeding) |
| Shell weight  | continuous | grams      | afer being dried |
| Rings         | integer    | n/a        | +1.5 gives age in years |
