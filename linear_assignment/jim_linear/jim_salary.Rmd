Predicting Salary Based on Job Description
==========================================

First, let's get the data
```{R}
train <- read.csv("<- read.table("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajschumacher/gadsdata/master/salary/train.csv")
test <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajschumacher/gadsdata/master/salary/test.csv")
location_tree <- read.table("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajschumacher/gadsdata/master/salary/location_tree.txt", quote="\"")
```

Let's try that DAAG library package for their cv.lm function
```{R}
install.packages("DAAG")
require(DAAG)
```
First lets take a look at the scattermatrix to see what we have
```{R}
plot(train)
```
That seems useless. lets try a few exploratory scatter plots.
```{R}
plot(x=train$SalaryNormalized) 
```
Looks ok to keep untransformed. but there are a few high values up there. That
should be something to keep an eye on in case they have too much leverage.

I love boxplots, so lets look by category
```{R}
bp<-boxplot(train$SalaryNormalized~train$Category, colour=train$Category)
```

We can now try to run the model just using the Category as the feature set.
```{R}
cvm1<-cv.lm(df = train, form.lm=formula(SalaryNormalized~Category), m=3)
```
The mse for this is approximately 2 million. that seems high.

lets add some more details to the model by using grepl for some potential key words and then check it out.
```{R}
train$has.technology<-grepl('technology', train$FullDescription)
train$has.financial<-grepl('financial', train$FullDescription)
train$has.senior<-grepl('senior', train$FullDescription)
train$has.manage<-grepl('manage',train$FullDescription)

cvm2<-cv.lm(df=train, form.lm=formula(SalaryNormalized~has.technology + has.financial + has.senior + has.manage + Category + ContractType + ContractTime))
```

#this still looks weird. lets just forget it and use GLMNET!

```{R}
require(glmnet)


x<-model.matrix(~has.technology + has.financial + has.senior + has.manage + Category + ContractType + ContractTime, data = train)

y<-train$SalaryNormalized

m<-glmnet(x, y)
plot(m, label=TRUE)
```

```{R}

cvm1<-cv.glmnet(x, y) #default to lasso is fine.
plot(cvm1)
cvm1$lambda.min
```

Looks like glmnet likes lambda at 6.47
Let's see what coefficients it liked:

```{R}
cvm1$lambda.min
coef(cvm1, s="lambda.min")
```

Well, it kept them all. i don't really like that. I'd prefer a 
simpler model, so I'm going to use the 1se lambda.
```{R}
cvm1$lambda.1se
coef(cvm1, s='lambda.1se')
```

That looks a little better, so I think we can try this against the test data.

```{R}

test$has.technology<-grepl('technology', test$FullDescription)
test$has.financial<-grepl('financial', test$FullDescription)
test$has.senior<-grepl('senior', test$FullDescription)
test$has.manage<-grepl('manage',test$FullDescription)
test2<-test[test$Category!='Part time Jobs',]
test2$Category<-factor(test2$Category)

new.x<-model.matrix(~x, data = test2)


new.x<-model.matrix(~has.technology + has.financial + has.senior + has.manage + Category + ContractType + ContractTime, data = test2)

test2$predictions<-predict(cvm1,newx=new.x, s=426)
```

So now we have predictins. It's time to see how they do
against the solutions

```{R}
solution$predictions<-predict(cvm1, newx=new.x, s=426)

>Error in `$<-.data.frame`(`*tmp*`, "predictions", value = c(30523.3755576254,  : 
  replacement has 4990 rows, data has 5000
  
```
That's annoying. The predictions are reduced because I subtracted
out the part time jobs category. Just for now, I'll substract it
out on the solutions and see how it works.

```{R}
solution<-solution[solution$Category!='Part time Jobs',]
solution$predictions<-predict(cvm1, newx=new.x, s=426)
```

I'm going to do this by hand because sometimes I forget how the models do it

```{R}
solution$resid<-solution$SalaryNormalized-solution$predictions
solution$sq.resid<-solution$resid**2
mean(solution$sq.resid) #2.86e+08
sqrt(mean(solution$sq.resid)) #16917
```

This feels like a pretty big gap. Not especially satisfied!

```{R}
plot(solution$resid)
```

There's something interesting going on there that it captures very well for a particular class of job. But the earlier ones in the index don't seem to do as well.
